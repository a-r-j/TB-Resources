[tbvar | Mycobacterium tuberculosis Variome Resource](http://genome.igib.res.in/tbvar/index.html)  - **TB Variome**    

*In this report, we have re-analyzed data sets corresponding to over 400 isolates of Mtb available in public domain to reveal a comprehensive variome of Mtb comprising of over 29,000 single nucleotide variations, which has been deposited into a database (tbVar). Using a systematic computational pipeline, we have annotated potential functional variants and drug-resistance associated variants. Apart from a user-friendly interface, the database has a novel option to annotate variants from clinical re-sequencing of Mtb. To the best of our knowledge tbvar is the largest and most comprehensive genome variation resources for Mycobacterium tuberculosis.*

### Drug-related Databases
[MtbVeb: A web portal for designing vaccine for mycobacterium tuberculosis](http://crdd.osdd.net/raghava/mtbveb/index.php) - **Vaccine Strain Data**  
*MtbVeb is a web-based platform developed for designing vaccines against existing and emerging strains of mycobacterium tuberculosis. This includes drug resistant and extreme drug resistant M.Tb strains. It also allow users to design vaccines against M.tb using all three appraoches (strain, antigen and epitope based vaccines).*

*The current version of portal maintain comprehensive genomic information about 59 mycobacterium strains that includes 4 vaccine strains, 6 clinical isolates, drug resistant strains. In this study, we provides comprehensive information in the term of antigenicity of about 178 potential vaccine candidates in each of the strain.*

[TBDREAM](https://tbdreamdb.ki.se/Info/Default.aspx)  - **TB Drug Resistance Mutations**  

*In response to this urgent need to improve diagnostics of resistant TB, we have compiled a comprehensive list of the genetic polymorphisms associated with first and second line drug resistance in clinical M. tuberculosis isolates throughout the world. We have reviewed the most common mutations found for the major groups of anti-tuberculosis drugs, establishing a database that we hope will enable the development of sequence based tools for diagnosis and surveillance of drug resistance in tuberculosis.*
